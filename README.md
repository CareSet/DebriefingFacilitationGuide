# CareSets Fork of the Etsy Post Mortem Debriefing Facilitation Guide

CareSet systems needs a Post Mortem process that is somewhere between the practices that happen inside hospitals and those common in the software and data engineering industry. In some cases, the Etsy guide has has some intensity reduced because it is not appropriate to pretend that lose of life can occur because of downtime for a consumer website. But for a healthcare technology company, our mistakes can cause harm to patients. We need something that has the context of the technology industry but also embraces the full weight of the Patient Safety movement. 

# Original Etsy Debriefing Facilitation Guide Notes

In 2012, Esty wrote a post for the [Code As Craft blog][cac_post] about how Esty approach
learning from accidents and mistakes at Etsy. We wrote about the perspectives
and concepts behind what is known (in the world of Systems Safety and Human
Factors) as the New View on “human error.” Etsy also wrote about what it means for
an organization to take a different approach, philosophically, to learn from
accidents, and that Etsy was such an organization.

This Debriefing Facilitation Guide is an attempt to complement this blog post
with a more practical guide about how Etsy approach learning from incidents in
practice.

You can read more about the backstory of Etsy's work [here][cac_post2] and guide is available
in [markdown][markdown_guide] or [PDF][pdf_guide].
